REQUIREMENTS:

Read into lab automation design in general: Keywords
Laboratory automation


My SiLA server:
Features: 
	- Connect to robot
	- Move robot
	- Read bar code


Project plan:
Design / order components section should be expanded to include SW / HW / Electrical




OBJECTIVES:
- DIFFERENT INITIAL VIALS: 4 different types. 3 known. different sizes and
extraction methods
- WHICH TYPE OF LIQUIDS ARE WE HANDLING? DANGER LEVEL TO HUMANS? No
- WAYS OF EXTRACTION 2 are decapped and
syringed out, while the last one needs pipetting 
- HOW ARE THE FINAL CONTAINERS? Only 1 type of container
- HOW SHOULD IT BE TRIGGERED? DO I NEED A FRONT-END CONNECTOR? Yes, currently
a UI shows how many batches and syringes are to be used by the robot
- INTEGRABILITY AND FLEXIBILITY TO CHANGING ENVIRONMENTS? Not right now 
with the current set up

SET-UP:
- WHAT IS THE LAYOUT? RESTRICTIONS AND CONSTRAINTS? One fixed trey to put 
syringes inside one by one (needs improvements) and the containers in
another fixed trey. A decapping / disposing station is used to unveil the 
tip of the syringe while the bottom gets pushed to pour the liquid inside of 
the container
- FIXED HANDOVER POSITION? Yes

DATA-READING:
- WHERE IS THE INITIAL DATA STORED? Currently, no data relating each container
too its corresponding syringe is in use
- WHERE SHOULD THE FINAL DATA BE STORED?
- DATA MANIPULATION?
- INTEGRATION WITH ANY OTHER DATA? Results from the observation could be stored 
next to the ID of the container

No good way of adding value, the qr codes can be read but each container still needs to be
analyzed and create their individual records in the lims system

TECHNICAL:
- MARGIN OF ERROR? Little no none, avoid leakage from pipetting (see papers, pre-wetting)
- ROBOT PRECISION? Ok
- CAN I USE TWO ROBOTIC ARMS?
- DIFFERENT GRIPPERS FOR HOLDING VIAL
- DE-CAPPING ATTACHMENT? Currently one in use outside of the robotic solution,
needs integration into the project
- INTEGRATION WITH SiLA. Creation of a digital twin.
