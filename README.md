# Universal Robots Arm Laboratory Vial Manipulation using SiLA Protocol

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of a **Universal Robots (UR)** robotic arm to automate the manipulation of laboratory vials in a lab environment. The project integrates the UR arm with the **SiLA (Standardization in Lab Automation)** protocol, allowing for real-time control via a modified **SiLA Universal Client**. The client was tailored to accommodate the specific needs of vial handling and robotic arm control.
